a fundamental element of olin's culture is trust. as such, our honor code requires all members of the olin community to conduct themselves with honor and integrity. our code, drawn from a few core values, consists of a small set of intentionally broad standards by which every action must be measured. while a small number of policies illuminate olin's principles, students live by the core values embedded in the code. itâ€™s a fundamental aspect to life at olin, both inside and outside the classroom, in our interactions with our professors or roommates, on campus and out in boston. the olin honor code values: integrity i will represent myself accurately and completely in my work, my words, and my actions in academic and in non-academic affairs. respect for others i will be patient with and understanding of fellow community members, and considerate of their inherent dignity and personal property. i will care for community resources and facilities so others may effectively use them. passion for the welfare of olin college i will be a steward for the welfare of olin college through a spirit of cooperation, concern for others, and responsibility for the reputation of olin college. openness to change i will be receptive to change, supportive of innovation, and willing to take risks for the benefit of the community. do something i will strive to better myself and my community and take responsibility for my own behavior. when i become aware of a violation of the honor code or an issue within the community, i will take action towards resolution of the situation. i expect others to do the same.
